//Qsno12- Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

//array
let names: string[] = ["Anila", "Fatima", "Areeba", "Saba"];

//forEach-Loop
names.forEach(names =>console.log(`Hello, ${names} Wellcome to first class.`));
